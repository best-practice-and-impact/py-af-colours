# Depecation Notice
Please note that py-af-colours has been superceded by [afcharts](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/afcharts-py), a python package which expands on the functionality of py-af-colours, and automates the implementation of much of the Analysis Function accessibility guidance. As such, py-af-colours is no longer being supported.

# py_af_colours
py_af_colours aims to support the creation of accessible Python graphs across
the UK Government Analysis Function by simplifying access to the standard
colour palettes.

If you're an R user, check out [afcharts](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/afcharts).

Take a look at the full documentation for py_af_colours [here](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/py-af-colours/).
